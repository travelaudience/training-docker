# tcp-echo-server

A TCP Echo Server ([RFC862](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc862)) built with
Vert.x for training purposes.

# Pre-requisites

For building the code:

* JDK 8

For running the server:

* JRE 8

# Building the code

The following command will build the project and generate a runnable jar:

```bash
$ ./gradlew build
```

# Running the server

**ATTENTION:** RFC862 specifies that a TCP echo server listens on port `7`, and
`tcp-echo-server` binds to this port by default. However, one cannot bind to
ports â‰¤ `1024` without adequate permissions, so the server allows an
alternative port to be specified via the `PORT` environment variable. For a
full list of all supported environment variables check
[Environment Variables](#environment-variables).

To run the server listening on port `2007` run:

```bash
$ PORT=2007 java -jar tcp-echo-server.jar
14:49:14.242 [INFO ] tcp echo server is listening at 0.0.0.0:2007
```

One can also bind to a specific interface using the `HOST` environment
variable:

```bash
$ HOST=127.0.0.1 PORT=2007 java -jar tcp-echo-server.jar
14:49:52.913 [INFO ] tcp echo server is listening at 127.0.0.1:2007
```

Finally, one can set `DEBUG` to `true` to get connection logging:

```bash
$ DEBUG=true HOST=0.0.0.0 PORT=2007 java -jar tcp-echo-server.jar
14:51:52.688 [INFO ] tcp echo server is listening at 0.0.0.0:2007
14:51:54.576 [DEBUG] open connections: 0
14:51:54.951 [DEBUG] connection from 192.168.1.10:52304 is now open
14:51:56.569 [DEBUG] open connections: 1
14:51:58.566 [DEBUG] open connections: 1
14:52:00.568 [DEBUG] open connections: 1
14:52:02.567 [DEBUG] open connections: 1
14:52:04.566 [DEBUG] open connections: 1
14:52:06.569 [DEBUG] open connections: 1
14:52:06.780 [DEBUG] connection from 192.168.1.10:52304 is now closed
14:52:08.571 [DEBUG] open connections: 0
14:52:10.568 [DEBUG] open connections: 0
```

# Interacting with the server

To interact with the server one can use `telnet`:

```bash
$ telnet 192.168.1.90 2007
Trying 192.168.1.90...
Connected to 192.168.1.90.
Escape character is '^]'.
HELLO
HELLO
BYE
BYE
^]

telnet> quit
Connection closed.
```

As one sends messages to the server one will see them being echoed back.
